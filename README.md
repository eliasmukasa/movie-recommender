## üìÑ About The Project

This project was built to showcase the fundamental principles of machine learning and full-stack web development. The core of the application is a Python backend powered by Flask, which serves a recommendation model built with Pandas and Scikit-learn. The model suggests movies based on genre similarity using a TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity calculations.

The backend exposes a simple REST API that can be consumed by any frontend. This project includes a lightweight, responsive frontend built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an intuitive user experience.
